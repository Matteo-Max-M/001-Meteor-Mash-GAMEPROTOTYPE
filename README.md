# MeteorMashGAME1
A silly unfinished prototype Unity game created in 2014 within a week with a small team for a summer game camp. 

Take control of a Meteor barreling through space as it collects space dust to increase its size, but watch out for objects that are too much larger than you! Gain enough mass and make it through to the planet to destroy it.

WARNING: Does not work properly on certain resolutions. Due to this project being made on an extremely old version of Unity, it isn't meant to work with certain settings.
